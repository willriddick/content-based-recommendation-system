	INTRODUCTION:
	
		You have likely scrolled through Netflix and noticed that the recommendation section is
		filled content that you are interested in watching. Call it creepy or cool, but what is 
		the math behind this?
		
		Sites like Netflix or Youtube use engines similar to the one below to provide recommendations 
		and ads that are geared towards specific users. There are two main ways to achieve this, 
		either by sampling other users, or by using only the content one user has viewed. These are
		known as Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering respectively. 
		
		The following is a Content-Based Filtering engine. I have chosen this method because it is
		easier to implement as a short example project since I will only sample one user.
	
	TOPICS:
	
		*	Matrix addtion
		*	Scalar multiplication of a matrix 
		* 	Vector addition
		*	Weights
	
	METHOD:
	
		The basic concept is simple. Given a matrix with MOVIES as ROWS and GENRES and COLS, we can
		input either 1s or 0s for whether or not these movies align with said genre. The user has watched 
		the following movies, and I have categorized them accordingly. 
			
				ENCODED GENRE MATRIX (watched):

										[Action]	[Animation]  [Comedy]	[Drama]     [Horror]    [Musical]	[Romance] 	[Sci-fil]		
				[Shrek]					1			1			1			0			0			1			1			0			
				[Star Wars: Ep 5]  		1			0			0			1			0			0			1			1			
				[Django]				1			0			1			1			0			0			1			0			
				[The Shining]			0			0			0			1			1			0			0			0			
				[Skyfall]				1			0			0			1			0			0			1			0			
			
		They will then rate the movies. The vector produced by their ratings can be multiplied by the 
		above matrix to produce a Weighted Genre Matrix.
		
				RATINGS VECTOR:
			
				[Shrek]			5
				[SW: Ep 5]  	8
				[Django]		8
				[The Shining]	2
				[Skyfall]		6
				
				WEIGHTED GENRE MATRIX:
			
										[Action]	[Animation]  [Comedy]	[Drama]     [Horror]    [Musical]	[Romance] 	[Sci-fil]		
				[Shrek]					5			5			5			0			0			5			5			0			
				[Star Wars: Ep 5]  		8			0			0			8			0			0			8			8			
				[Django]				8			0			8			8			0			0			8			0			
				[The Shining]			0			0			0			2			2			0			0			0			
				[Skyfall]				6			0			0			6			0			0			6			0			
		
		Now do addition on each row and then divide by the sum of the columns to get a normalized 
		value per genre.
		
				NORMALIZED VALUES:
			
								[Action]	[Animation]  [Comedy]	[Drama]     [Horror]    [Musical]	[Romance] 	[Sci-fil]	[Total]
				[User]			27			5			13			25			3			5			27			8			113
				[Normalized]	0.24		0.04		0.12		0.22		0.03		0.04		0.24		0.07	
			
		These normalized values are then multiplied by the encoded genre matrix of the remaining, unrated movies.
		
				ENCODED GENRE MATRIX (unwatched):
		
												[Action]	[Animation]  [Comedy]	[Drama]     [Horror]    [Musical]	[Romance] 	[Sci-fil]		
				[Dispicable Me]					1			1 			1  			0			0 			0 			0			0
				[Breakfast Club]  				0 			0 			1 			1 			0 			0 			1 			0
				[Ten Things I Hate About You]	0 			0 			1 			1 			0 			0	 		1			0
				[Get Hard]						1 			0 			1 			0 			0 			0 			0			0
				[Interstellar]					1 			0 			0		 	1 			0 			0 			0 			1
			
				WEIGHTED GENRE MATRIX (unwatched):
				
												[Action]	[Animation]  [Comedy]	[Drama]     [Horror]    [Musical]	[Romance] 	[Sci-fil]		
				[Dispicable Me]					0.24		0.04 		0.12  		0			0 			0 			0			0
				[Breakfast Club]  				0 			0 			0.12		0.22 		0 			0 			0.24 		0
				[Ten Things I Hate About You]	0 			0 			0.12		0.22 		0 			0	 		0.24		0
				[Get Hard]						0.24 		0 			0.12 		0 			0 			0 			0			0
				[Interstellar]					0.24 		0 			0		 	0.22 		0 			0 			0 			0.07
		
		We can then add up the columns for each movie to give us a float estimation of our likelihood 
		of enjoying said movie. If the number is closer to zero, we expect a user to dislike said movie.
		If the number is closer to one, we expect the user to enjoy said movie.
		
				ESTIMATED RATINGS (unwatched):
			
													[Rating]
				[Dispicable Me]						0.40	
				[Breakfast Club]  					0.58		
				[Ten Things I Hate About You]		0.58		
				[Get Hard]							0.36		
				[Interstellar]						0.53		
		
	IMPLEMENTATION:
	
		All of these matrixes can be represented in Java with two-dimensional arrays and therefore,
		the matrix operations that are required for this engine can be achieved using nested for-loops
		and basic addition/multiplication/division. For this reason, an engine like this can be easily 
		implemented and understood in most languages using object oriented programming.
	
	NOTES:
		
		There is a big disadvantage to Content-Based Filtering. Any genre in which a user has 
		not watched will not be found in their recommendations. This also means that genres that 
		a user enjoys, but not watched a lot of, will be less likely to be recommended. 

		Hence, the more movies that a user watches, the more accurate their recommendations will be. 
		And, the more genres that we can categorize movies into, the more accurate our recommendations will
		be for users.
		
		Given more time, I would likely add more movies and genres to produce a more accurate estimation.
		I would also like to explore collaborative filtering.
